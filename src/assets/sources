The next move by black is called the 4-4 point ( or hoshi) where it is marked with a small black circle. This point can surround a larger corner than a play on the 3-3 point. However, it can be invaded more easily because it has more spaces between it and the edge of the board. The fourth move by white is also a popular one. Of course, you can play anywhere on the board if it is not illegal. Usually, a game proceeds from the corners to sides and eventually to the middle.
