These spaces completely surrounded by stones of the same color are called territories.\n Now, the above three groups each have a territory of 9 points. Count the number of stones needed to surround the territory.\n\n Corner - 6 stones\n Side - 9 stones\n Middle - 12 stones\n  \n Therefore, it is most efficient to surround territories in the corners, while territories on the middle are least efficient.
